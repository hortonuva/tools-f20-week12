1. What you've enjoyed about this course : learning new skills such as working with github, python; my favorite was the advice about interviews from industry recruiters. 

2. What you would change about this course : Some instrutors seemed to have failed to notice that students were not as familiar with what they were teaching as them.
 
3. Any advice you have for next semester's students: I did not ask for help from the instructors. I ended up skipping/failing 4 weeks because I failed to do the assignment in time to have ample time to ask questions.
