1. What you've enjoyed about this course.

	I enjoyed learning more about the industry and how to better prepare for 
	getting a job in the software engineering industry. I liked the fact that the 
	assignments didn't need as much time and dedication as a normal class. So it 
	doesn't take too much time to get through them. But they are comprehensive enough
	to serve as a good introduction and a gateway to do more research yourself. 

2. What you would change about this course.

	There should be more group based and project based assignments. 
	We had the option of working in groups for some of the assignments, but they didn't
	really seem to be designed to be worked on by a group. In an actual job you work with
	a team all the time. And each person has their own unique role. That type of 	       	       dynamic should be captured in the class. 

3. Any advice you have for the next semesters students.

	While the content from this class can be useful on its own, it is important to
	do your own research on each topic. As well as furthering your industry
	knowledge on your own. No class can fully prepare you for working in an
	actual job, but it can help guide you in the right direction just as this class did.
