1)what you've enjoyed about this course?
It was a great learning experience for me and it opened a lot of doors for me to experience with cs myself. 
What I liked the most were the OH, because it gave me the opportunity to talk to people who are (1)more experienced programmers
than I am and (2)students who just trailed the path I intend to trail as well. I especially liked the option to schedule a mock 
interview with Jonathan on fridays and I think more of the upperclassmen should give students that option.

2)what you would change about this course?
I would make it a little more focused. I learned many concepts (like using databases, making virtual envs,CI/CD, testing and etc)
but not enough to try doing it myself, for the most part. I tried diving a little more into databases for a personal project and 
classes helped, but I feel like you could spend more time in each concept you want us to learn, enough so we could use it ourselves.
This way, we will spend our own times to dive deeper into the aspects that interest us the most. 
I understand that we can already do that(which is part of the reason I liked the class so much), but I think that if you decided to teach
a little more in depth instead of so many things it would be better.I also think you could start a 2 or 3 credit version of this easily.
Also, I'd make it more obvious that we have to do personal career development activities - at least I only discovered it a couple weeks back.
Also, make it more windows friendly for classes with command prompt.

3)any advice you have for next semester's students?
Even though you don't have to, try doing all weekly projects and pick some of the concepts to dive deeper in. And USE THE OFFICE HOURS, not only
for help on the HW, but to ask them for carrer advice.
