I liked that this course provided some baseline exposure to tools we will likely encounter in the workplace. For one of my PD activities, I spoke with a local employer who was overjoyed to hear that this course exists-- she said it will save them time teaching their interns how to use these tools.

I understand this is supposed to be a broad survey course, but there were a few topics I would have liked to further explore. You provided the resources for us to do so, but I feel like the assignments could be a bit more in-depth in order to really hammer in the concepts.

My advice to next semester's students is to get started early on the professional development activites. The semester rolls through quickly and you don't want to find yourself without an opportunity to complete all three.
