1. What you've enjoyed about this course
I really enjoyed how the class made us to engage with others with LinkedIn and GitHub. Learning how to utilize Github and helping us connected with other 20+ students on Linked-in was huge plus as a starting point. 

2. What you would change about this course
There was few activities that had lack of instruction (like week 7) and some I couldn't see the point of learning while it was fun (like week 7). I really enjoyed technical ones like building Linked-in profiles and helping students connected together and get to hear people from industry their experience and tips on internships. I wish the course set its direction to more towards this way.

3. Any advice you have for next semester's students
Take advantage of the shared linked-in roster and get connected with other students. And make sure to go see TAs for help when you need one because going to office hours can help you more than you imagine.
