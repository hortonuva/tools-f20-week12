1 what you've enjoyed about this course
    I enjoyed learning about new skills in this corse

2 what you would change about this course
    I had a hard time making time for this course since UVA Wise made this year real busy for me, I guess I would change the time for the assignments to be a little longer or more office hours.

3 any advice you have for next semester's students
    If you only one day to do the assignments thats fine since most of them did not take me longer than a few hours
